PosturePack is a smart backpack designed to improve spinal alignment by integrating real-time posture monitoring and an automatic correction mechanism using a sensor, motors, and an Arduino UNO . It detects slouching through an IMU MPU6050 sensor, which continuously tracks the user's spinal angle of flexion and when poor posture is detected, the system activates two NEMA-17 FLSUN stepper motors that adjust internal wires within the backpack straps to gently pull the user back into an upright position. If slouching persists for more than 30 seconds, the system loosens the tension to provide comfort in the cases of conscious slouching such as bending to tie your shoelaces. The project involved extensive research, prototyping, and iteration, starting with sketching and designing the system, followed by multiple 3D-printed prototypes of the pulleys and compartments to house components like the Arduino UNO, IMU sensor, L298N motor drivers, and battery pack (12V + 3V backup). The motors and electronics were wired and programmed, ensuring real-time feedback and precise actuation. PosturePack provides an innovative, user-friendly solution for preventing chronic back pain and promoting long-term spinal health, tracing back to the most common root cause of poor posture: heavy and/or poorly designed backpacks.
